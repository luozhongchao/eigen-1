We've updated the artwork view to make it even more like seeing the art in person:

• Swipe to view multiple images if available

• Tap and pinch to zoom to see the details of the work

• Evaluate the most important details about the work like medium, signature, certificate of authenticity, and more

We've also fixed some bugs, including: push notifications not opening the right conversation screen, an issue with "View in Room" AR feature on iOS 13, and an issue sharing artworks from the app.
